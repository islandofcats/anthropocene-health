## Acknowledgements

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the excellent [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) theme as its base. It is hosted with [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), which is also where the domain is registered.

## Copyright Information

Unless otherwise specified, all site content is public domain and free of restriction.

The only exception I can think of is the favicon / "logo" for the site, a blobcat emoji sipping coffee while surrounded by flames in the style of the "this is fine" meme. The "this is fine" meme was created by [KC Green](https://linktr.ee/kcgreenn). Blob emoji were originally created by Google. The informal blob_cat_ series seems to have originally been started by [@sairaa.jpg](https://www.instagram.com/sairaa.jpg/) on Instagram, but has picked up many contributors over the years - just search "meow" on [Slackmojis](https://slackmojis.com/). I am not certain who created the specific favicon this website uses. I presume it is distributed freely, but caution against replicating it or re-hosting with it without verifying this.
