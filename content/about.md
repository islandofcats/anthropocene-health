## Goal

This site is an attempt to gather useful information in one place for facing the health hazards of the anthropocene (which include pandemics, out-of-control wildfires, climatological disasters, and more) - it grows slowly to ensure that the information contained continues to align with the best available science and with the evolving personal experience of all contributors. If you find these guides helpful, you are encouraged to share them with others.

## Anthropocene?

From "anthropo-", of or related to humans, and "-cene", a transformation of the Latinized Greek _kainos_, "new", which also led to the Latin _recens_ (and thus the English word _recent_) - the era of or related to humans, the era brought about by humans.

The suffix "-cene" is used to denote comparatively recent periods - called _epochs_ - in geological history. While officially we are still in the "[holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene)" (holo meaning 'whole', 'complete'), which was coined to refer to the Earth conditions that have dominated since the end of the last glacial period, it has become increasingly useful to talk about modern Earth conditions as divergent from the holocene baseline - hence "[anthropocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene)".

## Acknowledgements

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the excellent [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) theme as its base. It is hosted with [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), which is also where the domain is registered.

## Copyright Information

Unless otherwise specified, all site content is public domain and free of restriction.

The only exception I can think of is the favicon / "logo" for the site, a blobcat emoji sipping coffee while surrounded by flames in the style of the "this is fine" meme. The "this is fine" meme was created by [KC Green](https://linktr.ee/kcgreenn). Blob emoji were originally created by Google. The informal blob_cat_ series seems to have originally been started by [@sairaa.jpg](https://www.instagram.com/sairaa.jpg/) on Instagram, but has picked up many contributors over the years - just search "meow" on [Slackmojis](https://slackmojis.com/). I am not certain who created the specific favicon this website uses. I presume it is distributed freely, but caution against replicating it or re-hosting with it without verifying this.
