## Contributions

You can propose new documents or edits to existing documents using GitHub. You will need a free account. Contributions of all kinds are individually reviewed by the maintainer and require approval to go live - though this process is subject to change. You can fork this repository if you'd like to take it in a different direction.

## Acknowledgements

This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site builder with the excellent [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) theme / template. It is built and hosted with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). 


## Copyright Information

Unless otherwise specified, all site _content_ is public domain and free of restriction. This includes the entire built version of the site, i.e, everything in the `Public` folder in the site repository. The site _code_ is subject to the MIT license because of the template being used - this does not restrict your ability to use, modify, distribute, sell, whatever the site code, but requires that the MIT license be included in all such works. As long as you leave the `LICENSE` file in the root, I think you should be okay (if you're a lawyer and that's wrong, could you let me know?)
