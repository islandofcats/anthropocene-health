## Indoor surfaces

After the smoke has passed, you should clean surfaces in your home that may be harboring soot and ash. Carpets and soft furniture should be vacuumed with a machine which has a HEPA filter. Countertops, appliances, and hard furniture should be wiped down with a damp cloth - use a light touch to prevent the ash from causing scratches. Any lingering particles can become airborne again after settling, so undertaking this step saves you from future lung irritation. Cleaning up before the smoke has passed should be avoided - you’ll kick up ash when the air quality is already poor, and you’ll likely have to clean again after the smoke has passed.

## Filters

All air filters should be inspected. Many or most of them will need to be replaced - soot and ash in your filter reduces its efficacy and can become dislodged later, posing a health risk all over again. This is true for air filters, HVAC filters, and even the air filters - engine *and* passenger - in your car.

## Clothes, blankets, and other fabrics

Your typical laundry practices will likely be sufficient to clean clothes that only received mild indoor exposure. If they were in outdoor air, or the smoke was particularly bad, they may need additional attention. There’s many ways to tackle this:

Use vinegar in place of fabric softener - use up to a half cup per laundry load, either via the fabric softener dispenser (where the machine will dilute it as it uses it) or, in top-loading washers which don’t have a dispenser, directly into the drum during the rinse cycle, when it will immediately be diluted by the rinse water. Don’t add it to the detergent drawer and don’t add it during any other cycles - mixing vinegar with detergent causes both substances to perform poorly, and undiluted vinegar in contact with your fabrics can damage them.

A sprinkle of baking soda in the detergent dispenser (or added alongside the detergent to top-loading machines) boosts the power of the detergent and works as an effective odor remover.

I haven’t vetted this product personally, but folks I’ve spoken with enthusiastically support OdorKlenz as a smell remover. Products using a similar approach are likely also useful, though you’ll want to vet them. Pet-targeted enzyme-based laundry additives are another option.

With all additives, you may need to do an extra rinse cycle to clear lingering residue.

## Outdoor surfaces

Outdoor surfaces you are responsible for may need to be cleaned, too - ash and soot can contain sodium hydroxide, which becomes lye in the presence of water. A hard rain will generally clear out surface accumulations, but a soft rain, mist, or fog could cause concentrated ashy droplets to form that can substantially damage painted surfaces and clear coats. Hosing the surface down (or inundation with a bucket) generally takes care of this, because any resulting lye is too dilute to cause harm. Cars can be hosed down in a pinch, but it’s better to take them to a touchless car wash where the resulting pollution is captured rather than allowed to enter groundwater. Brush-style car washes can rub the ash into the clear coat and scratch it.
