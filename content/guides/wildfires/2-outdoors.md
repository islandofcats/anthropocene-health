## Wear a mask

Ideally, a fit-tested N95 or better. KN95s, KF94s, and similarly-rated masks are nearly as good - just be aware that ear loops can't really guarantee the same seal as head loops. In a pinch, a cloth mask, a tightly-wrapped article of clothing, or any kind of physical barrier you can breathe through is better than nothing. It's all about reducing exposure.

In particularly heavy smoke, fabric masks like those rated N95 may clog too quickly to be safe to use. If you find that it quickly becomes difficult to breathe through such a mask, bring extras and swap them out as needed. Pay close attention to how you feel to be sure that you are getting enough air. In this situation it likely makes sense to acquire an elastomeric respirator (such as one rated P100) - these use multi-layer filters that are much more effective at tackling prolonged and heavy particle loads. They also form an excellent seal with your face, giving you peace of mind.

## Limit activity and slow down

Exertion of any kind increases the amount of air your body needs to function. This correspondingly increases your exposure to the dangerous particulates in smoke. Skip your bike ride, abbreviate your dog walk, do your best to limit the time you spend outside. The smoke will pass.

Plan for things to take longer. You may find yourself surprised by how quickly you feel out of breath, even during tasks that are usually easy for you. Take your time when walking or wheeling. Take breaks often. Try to stick to low-energy activities. Reduce your expectations - it’s okay if things feel hard to accomplish. Being inundated in smoke is a serious thing!

## Keep pets safe, too

The air is as dangerous to them as it is to you, and they can’t take any action to protect themselves. Some dog owners have had luck with dog masks, but these should be used with caution because they can stop your dog from panting - their main way of keeping cool.

## Protect yourself

If you must be outdoors, cover up. Long shirts and pants keep soot and ash away from your skin, where it can be an irritant. Glasses and goggles can protect your eyes. A hat will protect your head. Anti-inflammatories and antihistamines can both be useful for moderating the symptoms of smoke exposure. Definitely bring your inhaler along if you have one.

When you return home, change your clothes and collect the dirty clothes where they won’t get moved around (kicking up ash and soot) prior to cleaning. Keep clean damp washcloths in your fridge or freezer and use them to wipe down exposed skin on your limbs and face - it feels really nice and cleans you up.
