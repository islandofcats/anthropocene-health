## Understand the harm

Smoke - any smoke - is dangerous to breathe. The biggest danger comes from a class of particles we call PM2.5 - those which have a size of 2.5 microns or smaller. Pollutants in this range are difficult for the lungs to clear. They accumulate over time - all exposure increases your lifetime risk of lung disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD. PM2.5 pollution is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI - in general, everyone should be masking and limiting exposure when their local AQI is greater than 100 or so - fresh air typically rates in the 20s to 30s.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) also uses the AQHI. This is a simplified scale which has gradations in risk exposure for levels from 1 to 10, but which can rise to much higher numbers to indicate the severity of air quality disasters - something wildfire smoke readily qualifies as.

Air pollution generally is linked to a large variety of chronic conditions which reduce your health and well-being. Protecting yourself and your loved ones from pollution is important - particularly in young children whose bodies and lungs are still developing.

## Stay informed

The danger posed by smoke changes throughout the day, so timely information is important for decision-making. Online resources are great for this.

### Purple Air

A map showing air quality monitoring stations around the world. The sensors shown are inexpensive and hosted by institutions, businesses, and random folks who are interested in surfacing this data to the world. This map allows you to quickly see what the real-time AQI is in your area.

Note that, by default, Purple Air doesn’t apply any weighted correction to the AQI it displays. This means that measurements on Purple may show somewhat higher numbers than other resources. The top-left box on the map display allows you to pick the US EPA correction equation or any others of interest.

### FireSmoke.ca

A map which depicts large fires and smoke plumes in North America at present, as well as where they are expected to move in the near future. Even during a serious smoke event, the actual concentration of dangerous particles around you can change substantially throughout the day. Try to schedule your outdoor time for periods when the smoke is lighter.

### fire.airnow.gov

Another readily browsable map resource which shows both air quality readings and wildfire smoke. The smoke layer seems to be consistently of a lower resolution than FireSmoke.ca, but is generally useful. This map combines Purple Air’s sensor network with other networks and may be more comprehensive. US EPA AQI correction is applied by default and the sensors which are shown have been vetted.

### Other

Your phone’s weather app likely includes information on air quality. iPhones running iOS 16 can display an AQI widget on their lock screen for glanceable data. Just remember that services which let you check individual stations (e.g. Purple Air) are more accurate.

## Stay hydrated

You'll need more water than normal to cope with the adverse conditions. Your lungs turn water into mucous, which helps them clear accumulated particles out. The sooner they can do this, the better.

## You may feel sick

Smoke exposure leads to headaches, fatigue, anxiety, difficulty breathing, and many other symptoms. Those who suffer from allergies or asthma should expect these conditions to worsen while the smoke lingers. Everyone can be affected by smoke exposure, even 'healthy' individuals.

## Don't sweat the smell

Even with a well-fitting mask or portable respirator, you may find yourself smelling wildfire smoke. Many of the odors our noses can detect are too small to be reliably filtered - the static charge present on meltblown fabric masks (KN94, KN95, N95, etc) can prevent some smell intrusion but not all. Particles capable of making it through this kind of mask likely do not pose a risk to you.

Correspondingly, the air quality can be incredibly poor without any smell.

## It isn’t just wood smoke

Wildfires quickly expand to consume everything in their path, including vehicles, homes, and other buildings. Burnt material joins the rest of the smoke. For this reason it’s much more dangerous than, say, being around a campfire.
