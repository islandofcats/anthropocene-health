## Keep the windows closed!

The fewer particulates which enter your home, the better. While few buildings are truly air-tight, windows are deliberately effective for air exchange. This may seem obvious, but I've seen too many homes and businesses fail to take this extremely important and simple precaution - it merits inclusion.

If you need fresh outdoor air - for example, because CO2 is accumuluating - try your best to only allow it to come through a filter. Furnace filters can be found at many stores or ordered online. Cover any gaps left on the window and seal all of the seams with painter's tape, which can be easily removed without residue later.

## Block outdoor air intrusion

Doors and windows can be sealed off with painter's tape if they aren't in use. It is designed to come off easily after the fact, without damaging surfaces.

In heavy smoke, you can use soaked rolled-up towels to cover door thresholds.

Try not to run exhaust fans, such as those in bathrooms and kitchens, when it can be avoided. These cause your indoor space to have negative pressure relative to the outdoors, drawing in more outside air through cracks and crevices.

## Filter your air

If your home (or apartment building) has a central air circulator (such as a furnace) which uses filters, see if you can find HEPA-rated filters that fit, or get the super to do so. Then, run the circulator fan - most furnace control panels allow you to do this without heating or cooling, though adding either to the mix is also fine. This will handle most of the burden for you.

Standalone HEPA-rated air purifiers are widely available. Anything which meets this standard will make an important difference in your indoor air. Purchase only from a reputable vendor - steer clear of third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart.

You can also make a DIY air purifier, also known as a Corsi-Rosenthal box: a relatively cheap (for its effectiveness) construction of furnace filters and a box fan which was popularized in the early pandemic. See below for a guide and links to further information. There are many designs with trade-offs in cost, clean air delivery rate (CADR), and space. The simplest iteration - a filter taped to the intake side of a fan - is still much better than nothing.

## Humidity helps

Water is heavier than air and likes to precipitate out of it when it can. Smoke particles, which act as nucleation sites, are exactly what water needs in order to do this. A humid indoor environment forces them out of the air and onto surfaces where they canâ€™t harm you as easily.

There are many ways to humidify your indoors. Commercially available humidifiers work well so long as you maintain them and keep them clean - unmaintained humidifiers can quickly become dangerous mold hazards. Alternately, any standing water left out will evaporate at its surface and humidify the air. Consider filling up buckets, pots, and/or pans and leaving them out of reach of children and pets. This can also be accomplished by filling your bathtub or sinks. Use cool water. 

You can also raise the humidity in combination with other home tasks, such as by taking a shower but not using the vent fan. Dishwashers can be set to skip their drying phase and then opened to air dry, and clothes can be hung up out of the washer - these latter methods are unfortunately less useful in wildfire smoke, because you could end up with sooty dishes and clothes. Consider washing and hanging a less-loved blanket or some other alternative fabric - be sure to clean it well when the smoke passes.
